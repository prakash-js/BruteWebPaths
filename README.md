DirectoryBruteforce is a simple yet effective Python-based tool designed to perform directory fuzzing attacks on web servers. It uses a wordlist to brute-force potential hidden directories or paths on a given website. This tool is primarily intended for educational purposes and should only be used in controlled test environments where you have explicit permission to test the security of the website or server.
